## FROM GPARTED ON THE LIVE DISK:
#################################
Make a GPT partition table on the SSD - If your motherboard uses BIOS this partition must be MBR(msdos)
	Make a 1gb partition labeled "boot"
		This partition must be FAT32 type (aka 'vfat')
		Mark flags with "boot", "esp", and "hidden"
	Format the remainder of the drive as EXT4 labeled "OS" or the os name

Make a GPT partition table on the HDD - If your motherboard uses BIOS this partition must be MBR(msdos)
	Make a SWAP partition that is 1.5x the side of your RAM
		Label it SWAP
		aka "linux-swap" type
	Leave an amount of unallocated space that is [reasonable for /tmp and /var]
		I used 40gb
	Make an EXT4 partition that for the remainder of the space
		Partition type = ext4


#################################
## FROM THE GUI OS INSTALLER:
#################################
Assign mount points in Solus accordingly and install OS (in the OS installer GUI)
	the "/" is assigned to the largest SSD partition
	the "/home" is assigned to largest HDD partition
	the "swap" is assigned to the SWAP type
	the "boot" partition remains unassigned

============
Check that your home folder is the proper size
Continue the GUI installation and complete
DO NOT REBOOT YET:
Permanently mount /tmp to the HDD (to save your SSD)
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGCnEDML7Fk
	Create a new partition in gparted
	Use grsync to copy the CONTENTS of the /tmp folder (on the brand new OS) to the ssdSaverTMP partition
		Enable "Run as sudo" and all options to retain file permissions
		The destination for the files should be on the top level of the drive (not a /tmp folder inside of it)
	Run the sync and add a line to the /etc/fstab file similar to the ones below:
		# Move /tmp from SSD to HDD
		UUID=x   /tmp    ext2    defaults    0   0
Reboot

## ON THE FULLY INSTALLED OS (if your WiFi device isn't working):
#################################
This is how I installed my TP-Link  WiFi adapter:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/904698/tp-link-tl-wn722n-cant-connect-on-17-04

How to add the external TP-Link adapter to Linux distros:
Add the following lines to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:
	[device]
	...
	wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=0
Now save the file and restart network manager using (assuming Debian based Linux):
	sudo systemctl restart network-manager
If you're in Solus use this instead:
	sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
Reboot if effects are not instant.


#################################
## ON THE FULLY INSTALLED OS (if your kernal is not 'current'):
#################################
Run the below command to check your current kernel and what video drivers you are using:
	inxi -Fx
If your kernel is not current and you are on generic drivers AND you installed the OS as described above:
Navigate to /etc/fstab and add the following lines:
	## I added this to correct video drivers and kernel compatibility 
	UUID=x /boot vfat defaults 0 0
Replace the 'x' in 'UUID=x' with the UUID of the /boot partition you made above
	You may find this information in the 'Disks' or 'gParted' tools
Reboot to test your changes
If it worked run the following commands:
	clr-boot-manager update
	eopkg up
	clr-boot-manager update
Once complete use DoFlisky to install the correct/latest drivers


#################################
## ON THE FULLY INSTALLED OS (if you prefer the LTS kernel):
#################################
Install linux-lts with:
	sudo eopkg install linux-lts
	clr-boot-manater set-timeout 5
	clr-boot-manager update
Run the FreshInstallPack/app_installer.sh file in this repo.
