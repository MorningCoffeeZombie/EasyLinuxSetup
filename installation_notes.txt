Make a GPT partition table on the SSD - If your motherboard uses BIOS this partition must be MBR(msdos)
	Make a 1gb partition labeled "boot"
		This partition must be FAT32 type (aka 'vfat')
		Mark flags with "boot", "esp", and "hidden"
	Format the remainder of the drive as EXT4 labeled "OS" or the os name

Make a GPT partition table on the HDD - If your motherboard uses BIOS this partition must be MBR(msdos)
	Make a SWAP partition that is 1.5x the side of your RAM
		Label it SWAP
		aka "linux-swap" type
	Leave an amount of unallocated space that is [reasonable for /tmp and /var]
		I used 40gb
	Make an EXT4 partition that for the remainder of the space
		Partition type = ext4

## FROM THE GUI OS INSTALLER:
#################################
Assign mount points in Solus accordingly and install OS (in the OS installer GUI)
	the "/" is assigned to the largest SSD partition
	the "/home" is assigned to largest HDD partition
	the "swap" is assigned to the SWAP type
	the "boot" partition remains unassigned

============
Check that your home folder is the proper size
Continue the GUI installation and complete

This is how I installed my TP-Link  WiFi adapter:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/904698/tp-link-tl-wn722n-cant-connect-on-17-04

How to add the external TP-Link adapter to Linux distros:
Add the following lines to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:
	[device]
	...
	wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=0
Now save the file and restart network manager using (assuming Debian based Linux):
	sudo systemctl restart network-manager
If you're in Solus use this instead:
	sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
Reboot if effects are not instant.
