###############
## SSD Content:
###############
/boot	Kernal files for booting the machine (perm storage) (do this as ext2 or vfat)
/root	
	(/usr, /usr/local, /opt)
		/opt	Where some programs are stored (perm storage)
		/usr	Universal System Resources. Files that can be used by many programs freely (perm storage)
###############
## HDD Content:
###############
/home	Personal files (active storage) - this should be the last partition on the disk...so you can increase size if needed. DONT encrytp the home folder.
/tmp	Temporary files (active storage)
/var	Logs and temporary files (active storage)
Swap	RAM compensation/assistance

#########
## Notes:
#########
Swap
	The swap size should  = 1.5x to 2x the amount of ram you have
	Swap should never be on an SSD (if given the option to move to HDD)
	Swap should be partitioned at either the beginning or end of a drive for faster referencing.
		Or you can just make a swap file: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OEidskpcC0

#########
## Other:
#########
/dev	Devices and peripherals connected to the PC, not a filesystem folder.
/etc	System config files (perm storage)
/lib	Libraries (like DLLs in windows) (perm storage)
/media	This is where mountable media is accessed...aka flashdrives, iphones, etc
/mnt	
/bin	This is where programs live (perm storage) -steam game can be saved to /home/ from within steam settings
/sbin	More binaries. Where commands live


#########
## Goals:
#########
Install system files, apps & programs on SSD
Use HDDs for various types of storage
Enable "TRIM" on the drives to keep them clean automatically
