############
## SSD Content:
############
/boot	Kernal files for booting the machine (perm storage) (do this as EXT2)
/root	
	(/usr, /usr/local, /opt)
		/opt	Where some programs are stored (perm storage)
		/usr	Universal System Resources. Files that can be used by many programs freely (perm storage)
############
## HDD Content:
############
/home	Personal files (active storage) - this should be the last partition on the disk...so you can increase size if needed. DONT encrytp the home folder.
/tmp	Temporary files (active storage)
/var	Logs and temporary files (active storage)
Swap	

############
## Notes:
############
Swap
The swap size should  = 1.5x to 2x the amount of ram you have
Could I do ½ the [total size of] swap on the SSD and the other ½ on the HDD?
                NO- do not swap on an SSD as it will quickly degrade the device into unusability.
Swap should be partitioned at either the beginning or end of a drive for faster referencing.
you can just make a swap file: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OEidskpcC0

############
## Other:
############
/dev	Devices and peripherals connected to the PC
/etc	System config files (perm storage)
/lib	Libraries (like DLLs in windows) (perm storage)
/media	This is where mountable media is accessed...aka flashdrives, iphones, etc
/mnt	
/bin	This is where programs live (perm storage) -steam game can be saved to /home/ from within steam settings
/sbin	More binaries. Where commands live


############
## Goals:
############
Install system files, apps & programs on SSD
Use HDDs for various types of storage
Enable "TRIM" on the drives to keep them clean automatically
