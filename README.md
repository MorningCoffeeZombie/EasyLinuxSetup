# EasyLinuxSetup Scripts
Scripts, notes, and other documentation for Solus OS Linux distro. The goal of this repo is to retain the techniques used to fix/upgrade any issues arrising from my installation of the OS.

## SolusLinux Usage

1. Run ssdSaver.sh on the live disk after running installation.  
2. Run setupSolus.sh first-thing on the fully installed OS.  
3. Run appInstaller.sh after setup_solus.sh. This is recommended, not mandatory, and is therefore in its own script.  

x. Read installation_notes.txt at any point to understand the goals of this repo.  
x. Files prefixed with "resource_" are optional configurations offered throughout the scripts.
